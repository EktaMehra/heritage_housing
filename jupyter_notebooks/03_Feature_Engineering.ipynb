    "\n",
    "- Feature Selection: Determine the main determinants of home prices by evaluating the significance of characteristics using statistical techniques and a machine learning model (Random Forest).\n",
    "- Reduce multicollinearity by eliminating superfluous characteristics (such as TotalBsmtSF).\n",
    "- Feature Transformation: To lessen skewness and normalize features for modeling, apply transformations (such as log and standardization).\n",
    "- Make sure machine learning methods are compatible by dynamically encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "- Feature engineering: Using domain expertise, develop new characteristics such as house age, living area to lot area ratio, and overall quality-condition score.\n",
    "- Results Validation: For tasks involving downstream modeling, save the modified training and testing datasets."

    "\n",
    "**Important Points:** \n",
    "- Feature engineering choices were informed by statistical techniques, exploratory investigations, and domain expertise.\n",
    "- To guarantee consistency between the datasets, uniform transformations, scaling, and encoding approaches will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:** \n",
    "- This notebook follows the CRISP-DM methodology's Data Preparation and Transformation phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Actions:**\n",
    "- The price analysis notebook will use the converted datasets as inputs to investigate the connection between important characteristics and home values.\n",
    "- Regression models that forecast home sale prices will also be trained and assessed using the datasets in the modeling notebook."
