"""
Heritage Housing â€“ Inference Script

Purpose:
This script runs predictions on new raw property data using the finalized deployment pipeline.
It processes input data, applies the trained model, and saves the output with predicted prices.

Usage:
Run this script as a standalone module to perform batch inference on new properties.
