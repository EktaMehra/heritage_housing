Machine learning plays a central role in this project by enabling accurate, automated, and scalable valuation of heritage properties. By capturing non-linear interactions between features and prices, ML models provide insights that go beyond traditional appraisal methods.

### Objectives of Machine Learning

- **Accurate Price Forecasting**:  
  Train a regression model capable of predicting fair market prices for both standard and heritage properties, using historical sale data and engineered features.

- **Feature Impact Analysis**:  
  Identify which property characteristics (e.g., `OverallQual`, `HouseAge`, `GarageArea`) have the strongest influence on sale prices.

- **Real-Time Usability**:  
  Integrate ML predictions into a dashboard interface where users can enter property details and receive instant valuation output.

### Why Machine Learning?

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**:  
  Removes subjectivity in heritage valuations and ensures consistency.

- **Complex Relationship Handling**:  
  Models like Random Forest and XGBoost capture intricate, non-linear patterns that traditional valuation methods often miss.

- **Scalability**:  
  Once trained, the model can handle new property inputs and scale across additional use cases without rework.

- **Evaluation Metrics for Confidence**:  
  Metrics like RÂ², MAE, and RMSE are used to validate performance, making results explainable and trustworthy.

### Final Model Selection and Outcome

After training and evaluating multiple models, **Gradient Boosting Regressor** was selected for final deployment. It achieved:

- **RÂ² = 0.8774**
- **MAE â‰ˆ Â£13,000**
- **RMSE â‰ˆ Â£21,000**

These metrics met and exceeded the project's business requirement of achieving **RÂ² â‰¥ 0.75**, confirming that the model can reliably estimate sale prices of heritage and standard properties. The model was integrated into an interactive dashboard, allowing users to generate real-time price predictions and explore drivers of valuation.

âœ… **Business objective met:** The ML solution delivers accuracy, interpretability, and practical usability in line with the needs of housing stakeholders and estate planners.

_Note: MAE and RMSE values are approximated from log-transformed predictions and scaled based on typical price ranges._

## Known Bugs & Fixes

During the development of the prediction pipeline, the following critical bug was encountered and resolved:

---

### Bug: Mismatch Between Model Input and Trained Feature Set

**Error Message**:  
`ValueError: X has 17 features, but RandomForestRegressor is expecting 30 features as input.`

**Cause**:  
This occurred because the trained model was expecting a **fully preprocessed input** (with all one-hot encoded and engineered features), but the prediction data had only **raw or partially processed features**.

**Root Issue**:

- The preprocessing steps used during training (encoding, feature engineering, imputation) were **not applied consistently** during prediction.
- As a result, `X_test` or user input did not match the trained modelâ€™s expected schema.

**Fix**:

- Created a **single unified pipeline** using `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that includes both preprocessing and the model.
- Saved this full pipeline using `joblib`.
- During inference, passed all data (including user input and inherited properties) through the **same pipeline**, ensuring identical feature structure.

**Outcome**:  

- The bug was eliminated, and predictions now align with the trained modelâ€™s structure.  
- This reinforced the importance of using a **single, serialised pipeline** for consistency across training and deployment.

### Code Validation

To ensure clean, readable, and PEP8-compliant code, all .py files and Jupyter notebooks were validated using the Code Instituteâ€™s online PEP8 linter tool:
[PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

**Manual Validation Process:**

- Each script and notebook was copied into the CI linter
- Errors and warnings were reviewed line by line
- Necessary formatting changes were made (e.g., line length, indentation, spacing, unused imports)

Result:
âœ… All project files pass PEP8 validation with no critical warnings or errors remaining

## Deployment

The Heritage Housing dashboard was deployed using **Heroku**, making the tool publicly accessible for stakeholders to interact with the trained model and explore predictions and insights.

---

### Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Final Pipeline**  
   - Serialized the trained Random Forest model, fitted scaler, and preprocessing pipeline using `joblib`.
   - Saved output artefacts (prediction-ready datasets, evaluation metrics) in the `outputs/` directory.

2. **Streamlit App Structure**  
   - Developed modular dashboard pages in Python using **Streamlit**.
   - Configured sidebar navigation with clearly separated functional pages.
   - All artefacts loaded on startup to ensure a responsive experience.

3. **Set up Hosting Environment**  
   - Used **Heroku Cloud** for app hosting and deployment.
   - Added a `Procfile` and specified the runtime in `runtime.txt`.
   - Defined dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
   - Configured `.slugignore` to exclude large files (e.g., raw datasets and local figures) not needed in production.

4. **Connect to GitHub**  
   - Linked the GitHub repository to **Heroku** for continuous deployment.
   - Enabled auto-deploy from the `main` branch.
   - New commits pushed to GitHub automatically trigger redeployment.

### Deployment Considerations

- **Slug Size**:  
  Managed with `.slugignore` to avoid Heroku slug size limits by excluding unnecessary data files.

- **Reproducibility**:  
  Model artefacts and pipeline objects versioned and stored in `outputs/models/` and `outputs/pipelines/`.

- **Performance**:  
  Preloaded data and precomputed outputs to optimize dashboard responsiveness and minimize load time.
