**Challenges**:
- Data completeness: Many categorical fields had nulls requiring context-sensitive imputations
- Feature bias: Some high-cardinality fields created risk of overfitting
- Prediction pipeline complexity: Maintaining clean input schema between training and app

**Improvements**:
- Used `StandardScaler` + one-hot encoding for consistency
- Developed engineered features based on domain intuition
- Simplified pipeline deployment using `joblib` and Streamlit-ready interfaces

The final model and pipeline met both the technical and business goals of the project:
- âœ… Achieved **R2 = 0.87** on unseen data
- âœ… Accurately predicted prices for inherited homes
- âœ… Delivered a user-friendly app for future property estimation

These results support the modelâ€™s reliability for data-driven pricing decisions in the real estate domain.
