1. **Feature Impact Hypothesis**
   - Attributes such as `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `GarageArea` are positively correlated with house sale prices.

2. **Model Performance Hypothesis**
   - A regression model trained on the dataset can achieve **R2 â‰¥ 0.75** on unseen test data.

3. **Inherited Properties Hypothesis**
   - The model can predict sale prices for inherited properties aligned with market trends.
