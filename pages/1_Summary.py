This app contains the following sections:
- **Home** â€“ Project overview and navigation
- **Feature Correlation** â€“ Explore how property features correlate with sale prices
- **Hypothesis Validation** â€“ Validate business and modelling assumptions
- **Price Prediction** â€“ View predictions for inherited properties and run custom ones
- **Technical Summary** â€“ Dive into model performance and pipeline structure

This project was developed to meet the following business needs:
- **Price Estimation**: Deliver accurate price predictions for 4 inherited houses in Ames.
- **Feature Insight**: Identify key drivers that impact sale price.
- **Decision Support**: Empower the client with a usable tool for evaluating future properties.

The dataset used in this project originates from [Kaggleâ€™s Ames Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data).
It contains detailed information on housing attributes and final sale prices.

After preprocessing, the final dataset includes:
- Removal of outliers and missing values
- Creation of new features (e.g. `HouseAge`, `LivingLotRatio`)
- Transformation of skewed variables and log-transformation of `SalePrice`
