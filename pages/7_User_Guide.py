- **Missing Predictions?**: Make sure all required inputs are filled. Fields like year and square footage must be non-zero.
- **Invalid Value Errors?**: Check for typos or invalid ranges (e.g., negative sqft).
- **Pipeline Errors?**: If the app shows "feature names mismatch", ensure column names and categorical values match the training data schema.

If errors persist, check the technical summary or contact the project maintainer.
